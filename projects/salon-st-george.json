	"description": "In early February of 2013, I was approached by a sales associate at the development firm I work for, he passed on contact information for a salon in Richfield, MN. I met with Jody and Christy Nelson, owners and stylists at Salon St. George. They desperately needed a web presence and over the next year, we worked together to make that a reality. Their salon has been around for two generations now, providing excellent salon precision, certified barbershop grooming and hair replacement for those in need.",
